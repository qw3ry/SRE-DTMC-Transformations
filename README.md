# SRE-DTMC-Transformations

This is the implementation of the algorithms I developed in my Bachelor's Thesis.
The thesis has been done at the computer science department at the University of Stuttgart.

## Setup

I used Eclipse with Maven to setup the project.
Maven downloads the dependencies, with Eclipse I actually run the code.
Feel free to experiment with other ways to get this running, though.

## Structure

In `res` you can find the raw measurement results of the evaluation described in my thesis.

In `src` the source code itself is found.

`runEvaluation.sh` is a script I used to run the measurement for the evaluation without starting a graphic environment so I can reduce the overhead introduced by other running applications.
